## Welcome to my website!

My name is Gahl Shemy, welcome to my page! I recently obtained a pure math B.S. from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/) and will be starting a PhD at [Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) in Fall 2023.  My mathematical interests lie broadly in algebra and topology-- most recently I've gotten to explore modular representation theory, Lie theory, and algebraic topology.

I spent summer of 2021 at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/REU/REU.html), working on an REU in Algebraic Combinatorics and Representation Theory. I spent summer of 2022 at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/research/research-experience-for-undergraduates--reu-.html) (Ann Arbor) studying modular representations of certain finite groups of Lie type, under the direction of Professor Charlotte Chan and Professor Karol Koziol.

At UCSB I served as president of our Association for Women in Math for two years, and was co-president of UCSB's Regents Scholars Association for a year. I also worked part-time as a CLAS mathematics tutor before transitioning to my current full-time role as a mathematics instructor. Beyond math, I greatly enjoy playing soccer, reading, going on runs, skiing, hiking, thrifting, speaking Hebrew and French, and walking around big cities.

Feel free to check out the [blog](https://gahlshemy.github.io/blog) and some [course notes](https://gahlshemy.github.io/coursenotes) I'm currently working on. Also do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:gahlshemy@ucsb.edu) 
to me at any time if you have suggestions for study or just to chat :-P
