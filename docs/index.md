## Welcome to my website!

Hello! My name is Gahl Shemy and I am a third year undergraduate pure mathematics major at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). My mathematical interests lie broadly in algebra and topology (I'm still figuring out the specifics, but most recently I've gotten to explore algebraic combinatorics, Lie theory, and a bit of algebraic topology). 

I am currently the president of UCSB's Association for Women in Math as well as co-president of UCSB's Regents Scholars Association. This year I am working as a CLAS mathematics tutor, a position I've been looking forward to since stepping foot on UCSB's campus. Beyond math, I greatly enjoy debate, playing soccer, writing, going on runs, skiing, hiking, thrifting, speaking Hebrew and French, and walking around big cities.

Feel free to check out the [blog](https://gahlshemy.github.io/blog) and some [course notes](https://gahlshemy.github.io/coursenotes) I'm currently working on. Also do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:gahlshemy@ucsb.edu) 
to me at any time if you have comments on the site, suggestions for study, etc. I'd love to chat :-P
