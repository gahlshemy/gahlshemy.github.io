## Hello!

I'm Gahl, a third year math PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. I previously earned a math B.S. from UCSB in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I'm  interested in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, and generally excited to learn more group (co)homology and combinatorial topology/commutative algebra. My advisor is [Jenny Wilson](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/).

I'm very grateful to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Rackham Merit Fellowship (Rackham Science Award).

Beyond learning and doing math, I enjoy teaching math, playing soccer, reading, skateboarding, skiing, hiking, dj'ing, and thrifting.
