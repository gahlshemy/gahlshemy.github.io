## Welcome to my website!

Hello! My name is Gahl Shemy and I am a third year undergraduate pure mathematics major at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I plan to use this website to document some of my thoughts, projects, and ideas as I continue on my personal, academic, and professional journeys. 

I am currently the president of UCSB's Association for Women in Math as well as co-president of UCSB's Regents Scholars Association. This year I will be serving as a CLAS mathematics tutor, a position I've been looking forward to since stepping foot on UCSB's campus. Perhaps even greater than my love of math is my love of communicating and teaching mathematics (especially to people who may not have the same appreciation of the subject as I do), and I am very excited that I will have the opportunity to do that this year as a CLAS tutor. 

Beyond math, I've recently developed interests in data science and programming, as well as philosophy and world history. I also greatly enjoy debate, playing soccer, going on runs, skiing, hiking, thrifting, walking around San Francisco, and much more! 

Feel free to check out the [blog](https://gahlshemy.github.io/blog) and some projects I'm proud of. Also do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:gahlshemy@ucsb.edu) 
to me at any time if you have comments on the site, or anything, really. I'd love to chat!
