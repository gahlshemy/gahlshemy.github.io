## Hello!

I'm Gahl, a second year math PhD student at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math). Before this I earned a pure math B.S. from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). My mathematical interests lie mostly in commutative algebra, representation theory, and topology, although I'm still figuring out the specifics.

Beyond learning and doing math, I greatly enjoy _teaching_ math, playing soccer, reading, lifting, skiing, hiking, thrifting, speaking Hebrew and French, and walking around big cities.

Do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:gshemy@umich.edu) to me at any time if you have suggestions for study or just to chat :-P
