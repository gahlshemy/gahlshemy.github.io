## Hello!

I'm Gahl, a second year math PhD student at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math). I earned my B.S. in math from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I'm excited to learn more about group (co)homology and combinatorial topology/ commutative algebra. My advisor is [Jenny Wilson](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/).

I'm grateful to be partially supported by a Rackham Merit Fellowship (Rackham Science Award).

Beyond learning and doing math, I enjoy teaching math, playing soccer, reading, lifting, skiing, hiking, thrifting, and speaking Hebrew & French.
