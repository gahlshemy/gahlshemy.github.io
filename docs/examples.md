For a little over a year now I've been wanting to start collecting and compiling a list of examples/ counterexamples that I find interesting from my course textbooks, lectures, own reading, etc. And what better time than the present to start doing just that!

*Example 1*
**Cool manifold:** (almost topologists' sine curve)
