For a little over a year now I've been wanting to start collecting and compiling a list of examples/ counterexamples that I find interesting from my course textbooks, lectures, own reading, etc. And what better time than the present to start doing just that!

*Example 1*

**Cool smooth manifold: almost topologists' sine curve** Consider the set of points (x,y) in R^2 such that x does not equal 0 and y = sin(1/x). This is a manifold (WHY????)
