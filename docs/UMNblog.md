# University of Minnesota, Twin Cities REU in Algebraic Combinatorics and Representation Theory
#### June 13th - August 7th, 2021

It's been almost a month since I came home from my first Research Experience for Undergraduates, or summer REU. I thought I would take some time to reflect on the experience and what I learned from it.

I had lots of anxiety before leaving for Minneapolis. For one, I had never really conducted research before, and was really worried I wouldn't be able to contribute to the projects. Several months before the program started all of the participants got an email that listed the participants names and schools, and when I saw that almost everyone went to a top institution, I was *very* worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up and that everyone else would discover that I really don't know what I'm doing. In reality, all of the participants were extremely intelligent and hardworking, and I know now that I was chosen to be a part of that group because I too have something to contribute. In hindsight, my initial fears were very juvenile, and I shouldn't have let them make me so nervous in the weeks leading up to the program. I can only hope to use that realization going forward to not prevent me from knocking on doors I fear won't open.
