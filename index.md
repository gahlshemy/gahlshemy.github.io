## Welcome to my website!
I plan to use this site as a sort of one-stop shop into my professional and academic life. Feel free to check out the blog and
some projects I'm proud of! Also do not hesitate to [reach out](gahlshemy@ucsb.edu) to me at any time if you have comments on
the site, or anything, really. I'd love to chat!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gahlshemy/gahlshemy.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
