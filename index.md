### About Me

Hello! My name is Gahl Shemy and I am a third year undergraduate pure mathematics major at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I plan to use this website to document some of my thoughts, projects, and ideas as I continue on my academic, professional, and personal journeys.
