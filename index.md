### About Me

Hello! My name is Gahl Shemy and I am a third year undergraduate pure mathematics major at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). I plan to use this website to document some of my thoughts, projects, and ideas as I continue on my academic, professional, and personal journeys. 

I am currently the president of UCSB's Association for Women in Math as well as UCSB's Regents Scholars Association. This year I will be serving as a CLAS mathematics tutor, a position I've been looking forward to since stepping foot on UCSB's campus. Perhaps even greater than my love of math is my love of communicating and teaching mathematics (especially to people who may not have the same appreciation of the subject as I do), and I am very excited that I will have the opportunity to do that this year as a CLAS tutor. 

Beyond math, I've recently developed interests in data science and programming, as well as philosophy and world history. I greatly enjoy debate and welcome the challenge of grappling with viewpoints that differ from my own. In my free time I love to play soccer, go on runs, ski, hike, kayak, thrift, walk around San Francisco, and much more!
